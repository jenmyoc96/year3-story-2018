<h1>Chapter 2 </h1>
<p>
As Prim walks up to the stage, Katniss, in a panic, rushes forward and shouts that she is volunteering as tribute.
  A volunteer is allowed to take the place of the person whose name is drawn, but this never happens in District 12. 
  Katniss and Prim embrace, and Gale has to pull Prim away from Katniss.
  Katniss fights back any sign of emotion because crying will make the other tributes think she’s weak.
  Effie Trinket asks for a round of applause, but the crowd remains silent and offers only a gesture of respect to Katniss. 
  Haymitch falls off the stage while offering his congratulations.

The name of the boy tribute is drawn and it’s Peeta Mellark. 
Katniss thinks about her interaction with Peeta years earlier. 
Her father had just died, and her mother fell into severe depression. 
They had run out of money and food—starvation is common in District 12, she says—and Katniss had wandered into the lane behind the shops of the wealthier townspeople. 
She searched the trash bins but found nothing. Suddenly a woman was screaming at her to leave from the back door of the bakery.
Peeta, who was in Katniss’s grade, was there, and he and the woman (his mother) went back inside. 
There was a commotion, then Peeta returned with two burned loaves of bread, his mother yelling behind him to feed them to the pigs. 
He had a welt on his cheek where his mother had hit him. He cautiously threw the loaves to Katniss instead. 
Katniss brought the bread home and fed her family.
It made her hopeful they wouldn’t starve, and she wondered if he had burned the bread on purpose to help her, despite knowing his mother would hit him for it.
Later, she saw Peeta at the same time that she saw the first dandelion of spring.
Recalling that dandelions are edible, she realized she would have to use the skills her father taught her to keep herself and her family alive, and she associates this realization with Peeta.
