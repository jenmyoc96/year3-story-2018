atniss Everdeen, who tells her story in the first person, wakes up.
It is the day of the reaping. She sees her little sister, Prim (short for Primrose), asleep in bed with their mother across the room.
Katniss puts on her clothes to go hunting. The area where she and her family live is called the Seam, and it’s part of District 12. 
They are at the edge of the district, which is enclosed by a high fence, and Katniss often crawls under the fence and enters the woods outside, where she forages and hunts. 
Her father taught her these skills before his death in a mine explosion when she was eleven years old, and she uses a bow he made.
Though trespassing in the woods and poaching are illegal, nobody pays attention, and Katniss even sells meat to the Peacekeepers who are supposed to enforce the laws.
Most people in the district, she explains, don’t have enough food.
