<h1>Chapter3 </p>
<p>Katniss is escorted into the Justice Building and left in a room. 
Her mother and sister are brought in to say their goodbyes, and Katniss makes her mother promise not to fall apart again.
She tells them she loves them as they’re led out. Peter Mellark’s father, the baker, comes in. 
Katniss often trades him squirrels for bread. He gives Katniss cookies and promises to make sure Prim is being fed.
Next, Madge enters. She gives Katniss a pin with a gold bird in the center and asks Katniss to wear it into the arena.
Lastly, Gale enters. He tells Katniss to find a bow if she can, and he says he won’t let Katniss’s family starve.

<p>
Katniss is driven to a train station where she meets Peeta, and they board a train and begin their journey to the Capitol.
Katniss says District 12 is in what used to be Appalachia. 
It is still a coal mining area, as it was hundreds of years ago.
The Capitol is in what used to be the Rockies.
Katniss realizes the pin Madge gave her is of a mockingjay, a type of bird that the Capitol once bred to spy on rebels in the districts.
It could remember and repeat entire conversations, but when the rebels found out, they started using the birds to feed the Capitol false information.
The Capitol stopped breeding the birds, but they survived. 
The pin is a small sign of rebellion. =D
